THESIS:
- [9/24/13] Keep writing!

PROTOBOARD LAYOUT:

CIRCUIT ANALYSIS:
- [8/31/13] Allow multiple sets of probes.
- [8/31/13] Should have multiple output options (values as text; graph; both)

UI:
- [8/31/13] Separate simulation from schematic, signal files should not have to
    be specified in the schematic, they only need to be specified at simulation
    time.
- [8/31/13] Should be able to select and manipulate wires just like items.
- [8/31/13] Would be nice if we only allow drawing wires from connector to
    connector, and have very smart wire drawing.
- [8/31/13] Copy/paste (? probes, grouped things)

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
- [8/31/13] Do a better job of finding feedback loops without delays.

MISC:
- [8/31/13] Efficiently limit size of undor/redo stacks.
- [8/31/13] More unittests.
- [8/31/13] Time permitting, it'd be really awesome if we allow doing basically
    anything that can be done on the board using only the keayboard (and not the
    mouse) a la vimium (http://vimium.github.io/).

THESIS:
- [9/7/13] [9/7/13] Automate testing on a set of schematic files.
- [9/11/13] [9/7/13] Outline paper.
- [9/13/13] [9/7/13] Prepare a large test suite of schematics.

CIRCUIT ANALYSIS:
- [9/7/13] [9/7/13] Must support robot analog input/output.
- [10/16/13] [8/31/13] Use CMax simulator, or emulate it; one important issue is
    detecting Op Amp positive feedback.
- [10/16/13] [8/31/13] It should not be necessary that all nodes are connected
    to perform analysis, allow disconnected items.

PROTOBOARD LAYOUT:
- [9/13/13] [9/3/13] Setup testing automated framework for how well protoboard
    generation is working.
- [9/14/13] [8/31/13] Should know where there are too many items to be put on
    the protoboard, and output an error message if that is the case.
- [9/24/13] [8/31/13] For a particular pair of locations, try multiple pairs of
    locations by randomly sampling, don't give up if the heuristically best pair
    fails. (WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL)
- [10/16/13] [8/31/13] If the layout generation fails at a particular pair of
    locations, output what it has found so far. Better yet, let the user help it
    out!
- [10/31/13] [8/31/13] post process protoboards to make them prettier.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:

UI:
- [8/31/13] [8/31/13] Selection rectangle looks a lot like wires, make it look
    different.
- [8/31/13] [8/31/13] Don't allow drawing 0-length wires.
- [9/2/13] [8/31/13] Ensure that the tooltip label for Op Amps is written in the
    correct order, and make the same consideration for highlighting.
- [9/3/13] [8/31/13] Don't allow items on the board to ever overlap; give each
    item some buffer room, and don't let any other item within this room.
- [9/3/13] [8/31/13] Allow adding an item to the board multiple times (just put
    the items at different places on the board).
- [9/24/13] [8/31/13] Wrapper for matplotlib plotters (something similar already
    exists in lib601), matplotlib plotters block everything else.
- [10/16/13] [8/31/13] Somehow show the simulation file selected clearly (either
    name, or a graph of the signal).
- [10/16/13] [8/31/13] Crossing wires should be marked by a little curve.
- [10/18/13] [8/31/13] When hover over an item on the board, highlight
    respective item on protoboard, and vice versa.
- [10/27/13] [8/31/13] A wire that is drawn and snapped to an existing wire
    should be connected to that wire (break existing wire into two pieces).
- [10/27/13] [8/31/13] Click and drag on a wire should start drawing a new wire
    that is connected to that wire (break existing wire into two pieces).
- [10/27/13] [8/31/13] On dragging items, keep wires vertical/horizontal.
