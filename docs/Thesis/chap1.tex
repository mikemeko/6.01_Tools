%% This is an example first chapter.  You should put chapter/appendix that you
%% write into a separate file, and add a line \include{yourfilename} to
%% main.tex, where `yourfilename.tex' is the name of the chapter/appendix file.
%% You can process specific files by typing their names in at the 
%% \files=
%% prompt when you run the file main.tex through LaTeX.

% This is an example of how you would use tgrind to include an example
% of source code; it is commented out in this template since the code
% example file does not exist.  To use it, you need to remove the '%' on the
% beginning of the line, and insert your own information in the call.
