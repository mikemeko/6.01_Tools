As an important component of the Circuits module of the first Introduction to
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science course at MIT (6.01), students
design and
build several circuits over the course of three weeks. When working on the
more intricate circuits, an unfortunately large proportion of students' lab time
is spent on laying out the circuits on protoboards. This project introduces a
new circuit schematic entry tool for 6.01, capable of automatically generating
protoboard layouts for circuits that students may design in the course. The tool
allows for students to build and analyze circuit schematics through a
graphical user interface and automatically generates protoboard layouts that
are almost always easy to build and debug.
The layout problem is solved by utilizing the $A*$ search algorithm exactly as
presented in 6.01.
