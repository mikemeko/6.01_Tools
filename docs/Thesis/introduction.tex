\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Statement}

In this paper, we discuss the problem of automatic protoboard layout generation.
Importantly, we are interested in automatically generating layouts that are
easy to build, easy to debug, and aesthetically pleasing. The tool this
paper discusses
is geared towards circuits that students would build in the
Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I\cite{sixohone} 
course at MIT (also known as 6.01).

We are motivated to solve the layout
problem in order to let 6.01 students spend more of their lab time thinking
about how to design
circuits and less time thinking about how to lay them out on protoboards.
In this project, we used the Python programming language to develop a tool
that lets students easily build and
simulate circuit schematics through graphical user interface (GUI).
After building and testing a circuit schematic with the tool, a student can
proceed to building the circuit on a physical protoboard based on the layout
generated by the tool. Not only does the tool generate a layout, but it
also displays the relationships between the original schematic drawn by the
student and the generated layout.
With this tool, a student's lab time will be spent mostly
on designing, building, and testing circuits rather than on the difficult, and
arguably less instructive, task of layout.

\section{Outline}

Chapter \ref{ch:background} describes in detail the terminology
used in this paper and explores the current infrastructure available for
6.01 students as well as previous work done in automatic layout\footnote{
Throughout this paper, the term layout refers
specifically to \emph{protoboard} layout. In section \ref{sec:prev_layout}, we
stretch this meaning to include layout on other kinds of circuit boards,
such as Printed Circuit Boards.} generation.
Chapter \ref{ch:methods} discusses how we solved the automatic layout problem,
including various
alternatives considered in each part of the solution, and how we evaluated
our solution. Chapter \ref{ch:results} presents data to compare the various
alternatives discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:methods}, and also evaluates the final
algorithm on a large test dataset. Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:discussion}
presents arguments for the choices made in our solution, and
also elaborates upon the results presented in Chapter \ref{ch:results}.
