\subsection{Treating Resistors as Wires}
\label{sec:resistors_as_wires}

The discussion in Section \ref{sec:placement} presented that we treat
resistors just as we do the other components. That is, we give each resistor a
fixed place on the protoboard in the first step of the algorithm before the
wiring step. However, resistors have the special property among the circuit
pieces that they can be thought of as wires of length $3$.
Hence, it may be possible to handle resistors in the wiring step instead of the
placement step. Chapter \ref{ch:results} presents a comparison of these two
approaches.

Note that treating resistors in the wiring step is not a trivial task. First,
there may be nodes in the circuit that are connected to some resistors, but no
other pieces. In this case, we must be sure to reserve space on the protoboard
for that node as the wiring step relies on the presence of each node on the
protoboard. Second, we must keep careful track of pairs of locations that need
to be connected by simple wires and pairs of locations that need to be connected
using resistors.

\subsection{Comparing resistor treatments}

We now look at the two alternative treatments for wires: as components vs. as
wires. From Figures \ref{fig:resistor_success} and \ref{fig:resistor_success_trend}
and Table \ref{tb:resistor_success}, we observe that treating resistors as wires
results in a considerably smaller success rate than treating resistors as
components. Recall that the wiring method used here is per-pair, decreasing wiring.
When treating resistors as wires, we get more location pairs to connect.
The key difference for
the location pairs that correspond to resistors is that in connecting the given
pair of locations with wires, one of the wires is required to have length $3$,
the length of a resistor. Intuitively, this restriction should make the search
harder, and the data we have obtained suggests that the search is indeed
significantly more difficult with the restriction than without.

When we treat resistors as wires, and the search does succeed, we observe from
Figure \ref{fig:resistor_time_trend} that it takes more time than treating
resistors as wires, as expected.

Finally we look at the quality of layouts produced by the two methods. First,
we observe from Figure \ref{fig:resistor_quality_trend} that treating resistors
as wires produces layouts with fewer wires and smaller total length of wires
than treating resistors as components. This is certainly expected because each
resistor can be suitably placed to require fewer wires than would be required
if we forced the resistor to reside in the middle strip of the protoboard. We
do note, however, that treating resistors as wires results in more wire crosses
despite requiring fewer wires, especially as circuit complexity increases. This
can be attributed to the fact that treating resistors as wires is likely to
produce more compact layouts in which wire crosses are more likely to happen
than the spreadout settings we force when we treat resistors as components.

In this comparison, we can easily state that, with a limited search (i.e. with
a search in which we have a limited number of states to expand), treating
resistors as components is a better strategy than treating resistors as wires
based on the big difference in success rate.
